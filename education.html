						<h2>What is geography?</h2>
						<p>When I tell folks that I am a geographer, their first response is usually "So, you probably know the capital of (insert any country)?" or "Oh, so like maps and stuff?" Geography is so much more than memorizing placenames and locating places on the Earth's surface! Geographers merge local and global perspectives to address today's social, economic, environmental, and cultural challenges. We are interdisciplinary by nature, bringing in theories and techniques from other disciplines into a spatial analysis of human, nonhuman, environmental, and biological phenomena. We ask the following questions: why is something located where it is? Why does it matter that something is located where it is? How did something come to be located where it is and not somewhere else? What cultural, social, economic, and environmental factors influence where something is? Geographers study topics as wide-ranging as distributions of Shakesphere-themed coffee shops to fluvial geomorphologies of Greenland. We are especially adapted to undertaking intersectional research that seeks to understand a phenomenon more deeply than just a cursory view. Geography is everything and everywhere!
