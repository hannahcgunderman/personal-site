								<h2>Empathic Community Activism</h2>
								<p>Understanding privilege, ability, and whiteness in environmental, human, and animal rights activism</p>
							</header>
							<hr />
							<p>We live in a world built on the exploitation of humans, non-human animals, and the environment. Because the broader systems of exploitation, violence, and suffering that exist across the globe can often be overwhelming, my activism is community-focused and aimed at making the spaces around me more compassionate and socially just. I primarily engage in activism in the areas of human rights and access to mobility, non-human animal rights, environmental sustainability, and LGBTQ+ rights and education. I am an able-bodied, White, cisgender, LGTBQ+ woman. Certain aspects of my identity, such as being a Queer female, place me in spaces of vulnerability in the social framework of not only the United States, but many other countries across the world. I also, however, significantly benefit from my whiteness and it affords me many privileges as I navigate my activism. Therefore, anytime that I am engaging with individuals and populations from underserved backgrounds, my words and actions must not speak for their lived experiences, but rather, stand in solidarity with their voices. </p>
